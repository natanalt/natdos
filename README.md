# NatDOS website
This branch of the [NatDOS](https://github.com/natanalt/natdos) repository hosts the main website of the project, hosted at <https://natanalt.github.io/natdos>.

It features a runnable VM with a live floppy of NatDOS, supported by the [v86](https://github.com/copy/v86) x86 emulator. The entire website is built and deployed by the [dedicated workflow](.github/workflows/website.yaml). The static website contents (HTML, CSS and JS) are present in the [`static` directory](static/).
